# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maxence Faldor, currently a research scientist intern at [Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai/). I am pursuing a PhD at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) in the [Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) lab. I am interested in ðŸ§  Artificial Intelligence âœ¨ Open-endedness ðŸ¦¾ Robotics ðŸ¦Ž Emergence. My research focuses on building open-ended and self-improving systems.

I am one of the organizers of **ICARL** (Imperial College Autonomous Reasoning & Learning), a student-led initiative at Imperial College London. Our goal is to foster a vibrant community for students and researchers interested in the future of AI and robotics.

Our main activities include:
- ðŸŽ¤ **Seminar Series**: We invite leading researchers from academia and industry (sponsored by **DeepMind**, **InstaDeep**, and **Iconic**) to share their work. Past talks are uploaded to our YouTube channel.
- ðŸ“š **Reading Group**: We meet bi-weekly to discuss recent publications in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, and Autonomous Agents. The group is open to everyoneâ€”feel free to get in touch!

Follow our activities and join our community through our official channels:
